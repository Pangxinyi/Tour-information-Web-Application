# Tour-information-Web-Application
• Created a tour web application that displays tour information to clients, including images, introductions and budgets of each attraction.<br />
• Utilized the Read More and Show Less options that allow users to choose how much information to display.<br />
• Implemented the Not Interested button to let users remove the tours that they are not interested in.<br /><br />
